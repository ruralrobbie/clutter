        <h2>The Idolatry of "Stuff"</h2>
        <p>We often mistake sentimentality for love. But if our "treasures" hinder our hospitality, they have become idols.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Myth of Preservation:</strong> You cannot save the past by filling your garage.</li>
            <li><strong>The Myth of Utility:</strong> An item unused for a year is an item buried in the earth (Matt. 25:25).</li>
            <li><strong>The Myth of Heritage:</strong> Your children do not want your clutter; they want your character.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="theology">
        <h2>A Theology of Enough</h2>
        <h3>1. Sovereignty over Stuff</h3>
        <p>If Christ is Lord of all, He is Lord of your square footage. Clutter is often a silent protest against God’s current provision, as we cling to the "manna" of yesterday.</p>
        <h3>2. The Sin of Stagnation</h3>
        <p>The Christian life is a race (Heb. 12:1). You cannot run effectively while dragging bins of 1990 behind you. We are pilgrims, not settlers.</p>
        <h3>3. The Command of Hospitality</h3>
        <p>A home choked by sentimentality cannot be a home opened to the stranger. Every bin of "maybe one day" is a square foot stolen from "today’s ministry."</p>

    <section id="heritage">
        <h2>Legacy Without the Weight</h2>
        <h3>The Artifact vs. The Covenant</h3>
        <p>Your children’s heritage is the <strong>Covenant</strong>, not the <strong>Curios</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identify the "Ebenezer":</strong> Keep the one item that tells a story of God’s faithfulness.</li>
            <li><strong>Destroy the Noise:</strong> When everything is kept, nothing is special. A single family Bible is a legacy; a basement of boxes is a burden.</li>
            <li><strong>The Act of Love:</strong> Decluttering today is a mercy to your children tomorrow. Do not leave them a warehouse to clean; leave them a life to emulate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Actionable Stewardship</h2>
        <h3>I. The Rule of Utility</h3>
        <p>Does this item glorify God, serve my family, or bless a neighbor *this month*? If no, it is a candidate for removal.</p>
        <h3>II. The "One Bin" Limit</h3>
        <p>Sentimental items should be curated, not hoarded. Limit yourself to one beautiful trunk. If it doesn't fit, it doesn't stay.</p>
        <h3>III. The Digital Hand-Off</h3>
        <p>Photograph the object. Record the story. Donate the item. You keep the memory; a needy neighbor gets the utility.</p>
        <h3>IV. Immediate Disposal</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Trash:</strong> Anything broken/decayed.</li>
            <li><strong>The Gift:</strong> Anything useful but unused.</li>
            <li><strong>The Keep:</strong> Only the "Greatest Hits."</li>
        </ol>

    <section id="prayer">
        <h2>A Prayer for the Cluttered Soul</h2>
        <p>Lord, grant me the grace to hold loosely what is passing away. Help me to find my security in Your Providence, not in my possessions. May my home be a theater for Your glory rather than a museum for my past. Amen.</p>
        <p><strong>The Goal:</strong> Not a minimalist house, but a <em>Ministering House.</em></p>
        <p><strong>The Result:</strong> Freedom to host, freedom to move, freedom to give.</p>
